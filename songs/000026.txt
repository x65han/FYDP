If we can call them friends 
Then we can call them on their telephones
And they won't pretend that they're too busy
Or they're not alone
And if we can them friends, then we can call
Holler at 'em down these hallowed halls
Just don't let the human factor fail to be a factor
At all

Don't
Don't you worry about the atmosphere
Or any sudden pressure change
'Cause I know that it's starting to get warm in here
And things are starting to get strange

And did you
Did you see how all our friends were there
And they were drinking roses from the can
And how
How I wish I had talked to them
And I wish they fit into the plan

And we were tired of being mild
We were so tired of being mild
And we were tired

I know we're gonna meet some day 
In the crumbled financial institutions of this land
There will be tables and chairs
There'll be pony rides and dancing bears
There'll even be a band

'Cause listen, after the fall there'll be no more countries
No currencies at all
We're gonna live on our wits,
We're gonna throw away survival kits
Trade butterfly knives for Adderall

And that's not all
Woah
There will be snacks
There will
There will be snacks 
There will be 
There will be snacks

And we were tired of being mild
We were so tired of being mild
And we were [so] tired

So don't you
Don't you worry about the atmosphere
