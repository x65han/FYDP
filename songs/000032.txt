Train Station
There's a train station inside of this train
Where the people go to try and escape
And with anxious eyes, we stand in line
Til' the cold ground shakes
To tell us it's time for the trains
Yes, it's time for the trains to stop

Some were steel, and some were gold
And each conductor raved
They shouted, "Buy your tickets
Save your souls!"
But one conductor sang:

He shouted, "You! Come follow me!
I'll buy your tickets and I'll pay your fees
Cause I know what you cost
Believe me, without this train you will be lost!"

So the rich men laughed and they walked away
But the poor ones felt that they should stay
So they told all of their friends, they told even strangers til there were ten
Thousands of people said, "Come, let us see this scandalous train that claims to be free
Just let him speak."

So he drew a picture on the ground
The stone moved just like sand
He said, "Throw your tickets on the floor
I'll give you mine instead."

And He shouted, "You! Come follow me!
I'll buy your tickets and I'll pay your fees
Cause I know what you cost
Believe me, without this train you will be lost!
Believe me, without this train you will be lost!"

The soldiers rushed in like a flood
Wild-eyed, looking for blood
They said, "Show us the one who lies, deceives
And claims his trains of grace are free

Cause we'll take his body to the track
And nail him there so he never comes back
Yeah, we'll take his body to the track
And nail him there so he never comes back."

And then the ground began to shake
We felt the stone beneath us break
And He came back, He came back anyway
And there was love, And there was love

He shouted, "You! Come follow me!
I'll buy your tickets and I'll pay your fees
Cause I know what you cost
Believe me, without this train you will be lost!
Believe me, without this train you will be lost!
Believe me, without this train you will be lost!"
