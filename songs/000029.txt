I met this pretty girl on the train
I fell in love before I even got her name
And I ain't even know where she was going
But she broke my heart when her stop came
On the L with some headphones on
I wonder what you bumpin' in those in-ears
I want to say what's up but I been scared
Vibes out of thin air, full car, blank stares
I wonder if you single or you got a man
I bet you like me you got a lot of fans
I wonder if you smoke if you drink too
I wonder if you care what I think too
We don't know each other but that's all good
I'm chasing love like we all should
I wonder where she headed, Lord knows
'Til that stop came and the doors closed
Girl on a train I know you're just a stranger
What is your name, where are you going?
Girl on a train I don't know where I'll find you
Still on my mind when I got home
Now I'm all alone
City is fucking heartless
Easy to get tarnished
Beauty in all the darkness
There's wealth in all the poverty
You're like I won the lottery
You'll never get tired of me
You remind of a lot of things
Martin and Gina, my Iliad and Odyssey
Girl I want to make you proud of me
I know I act stupid but you know I'm talented
The chaos the mayhem
Girl smile the suns out
The city got crazy
And that's why it's fun now
Feel what I feel
And stop where I stop
You know what this is and you got what I got
The feeling's so rare it don't happen a lot no
Girl on a train I know you're just a stranger
What is your name, where are you going?
Girl on a train I don't know where I'll find you
Still on my mind when I got home
Now I'm all alone
I wanna come in first place
Fell in love and we skipped all the first dates
Shook my world up like an earthquake
You got me fucked up in the worst way
I'm a stranger in the first place
But I'm there when you celebrate your birthday
Where that girl headed? Lord knows
[?] and them doors close
Girl on a train I know you're just a stranger
What is your name, where are you going?
Girl on a train I don't know where I'll find you
Still on my mind when I got home
Now I'm all alone
