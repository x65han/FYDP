When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh, stand now by me, stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me, won't you stand by
