Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago (dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans (dancing in the street)
In New York City (dancing in the street)
All we need is music, sweet music ( sweet sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere (everywhere)
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
It's an invitation across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
They'll be laughing and singing and music swinging

Dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street
