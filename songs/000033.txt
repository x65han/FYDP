Since you've gone, my heart said something's wrong.
How long can this keep goin' on?
I'm still blue over losin' you.
What else am I gonna do?
I'm buildin' bridges straight to your heart,
An' all of this distance won't keep us apart,
Won't keep us apart.
Talk to me, talk to me about sympathy.
Don't leave me beggin' on my knees.
Since you've gone, my heart says something's wrong.
How long can this keep goin' on?
I'm buildin' bridges straight to your heart,
An' all of this distance won't keep us apart,
Won't keep us apart.
I'm buildin' bridges straight to your heart,
An' all of this distance won't keep us apart,
Won't keep us apart.
I'm buildin' bridges, (I'm buildin' bridges.)
Straight to your heart,
And all of this distance won't keep us apart,
Won't keep us apart.
Straight to your heart.
Whoa, I,
Whoa I, I'm buildin' bridges,
Staright to your heart.
