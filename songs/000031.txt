Bus Station
Bus station, at sun-up, lookin' for a new, place to go
He sips his coffee, and he pulls his ring,
And thinks of how she looked years ago
And she curls up, with a blanket, in a yellow, plastic seat
He touches her, and she looks out the window,
At an empty morning street
Well, he musta had a screw loose, in his head
To end up like this after all he said
He lies to her, she kisses him, gettin' tired of love
Bus station, at sun-up, she reads the ticket, in her hand
It's a different name, for the same old town, and this ain't the life
That they had planned
And so he tries to tell her, it won't be like the, times before
It's a different town, and a brand new start, and he's gonna work a whole lot more.
Bus station, at sun-up, another hour, left to blow
He touches her, but she'd like to leave,
And there's no PLACE left to go
Well, she musta had a screw loose, in her head
How could she believe all the things he said
She lies to him, he kisses her, gettin' tired of love
Gettin' tired of love, gettin' tired of love
