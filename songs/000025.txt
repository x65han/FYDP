Here you are at last
To bring my cold lonely soul sweet release
From my weary past
Always searching, the one missing piece was you
And I beg you come away with me
And together we will find a place to call our own
I can't wait to see what I can do
With a laptop like you

It's not your CD slot
Or the UNIX on which you are based
You make my lap hot
Cause underneath your aluminum case there's love
And I forgive your strange one-button mouse
I forgive the way your keyboard leaves marks on your screen
I can overlook a fault or two
For a laptop like you

We will always be together
In love in spite of everything
Hang on tight through wind and weather
Heaven knows what time may bring

In a year or two
You will seem big and heavy and slow
I will carry you
To wherever it is laptops go to die

And don't think it won't be hard on me
How'm I ever gonna find a way to justify
The money I will spend on something new
For a laptop like you
For a laptop like you
