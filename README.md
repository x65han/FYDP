This is our Final Year Design Project in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of Waterloo.

Our team is researching a scenery-music recommender system under the supervision of [Dr. Alexander Wong](https://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~a28wong/). Designed for the visually impaired, users can start recording a short video of their ambient surroundings. Next, our application extract frames of the video, and then the image captioning model would generate a description of the surroundings. Finally, we recommend suitable songs based on the similarity between the generated captions and the potential lyrics. Recently, we had a successful [DEMO (Video)](https://u.nu/demo-cnib) with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind. Sincerely, we believe that our design philosophy to connect various domains – CV, NLP, and mobile development – with our “AI for Good” initiative blessed us with success.
