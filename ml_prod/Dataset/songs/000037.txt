Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
Don't the sun look good today?
But the rain on its way
Watch the butcher shine his knives
And this town is full of battered wives.
Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
I ride your river under the bridge
I take your boat out to the reach
'Cause I love that engine roar
But I still don't know what I'm here for
Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
They shut it down
They closed it down
They shut it down
They pulled it down
Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
