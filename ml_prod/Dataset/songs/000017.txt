Apologize
I'm holdin' on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound (Oh yea..)
They tell me that you mean it
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that your sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around 
And say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I take another chance, take a fall, take a shot from you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
It's not from you (Yeaaaa)
I loved you with a fire red and I was turnin' blue
And to say
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I'm holdin' on the rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
